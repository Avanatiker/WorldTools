WorldTools is a powerful Minecraft mod that allows you to capture and save high-detail snapshots of server worlds
locally.
It empowers you to download comprehensive information, including chunks, entities,
chests, players, statistics, advancements, and detailed metadata.
WorldTools ensures that you can retain an accurate and unaltered representation of the server's world for analysis,
sharing, or backup purposes on your local machine.

  </a>
</p>

1. **Installation**:
    - Install Fabric by following the [Fabric Installation Guide](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install).
    - Download the latest Fabric version of WorldTools from
      the [releases page](https://github.com/Avanatiker/WorldTools/releases)
    - Place the WorldTools Fabric mod JAR file in the "mods" folder of your Fabric installation.

2. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have the following mods installed:
    - [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
    - [fabric-language-kotlin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-language-kotlin)
    - [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config)
    - [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)

### Forge

1. **Installation**:
    - Install Forge by following the [Forge Download Link](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/).
    - Download the latest Forge version of WorldTools from
      the [releases page](https://github.com/Avanatiker/WorldTools/releases)
    - Place the WorldTools Forge mod JAR file in the "mods" folder of your Forge installation.

2. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have the following mods installed:
    - [Kotlin For Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kotlin-for-forge)
    - [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config)

### Usage

1. **Download**:
    - Enable capture mode: Hit `F12` the GUI (on ESC menu) or `/worldtools capture` to start capturing data.
    - Play the game normally while WorldTools downloads the all data. You need to open containers like chests to capture
      their contents.
    - Save captured data: Hit `F12` the GUI (on ESC menu) or `/worldtools capture` again to stop capturing data and save the world.
2. **Access Downloaded World**: Your downloaded world can be found in the single-player worlds list.

### File Structure

After capturing data, WorldTools creates the following files in the world directory's folder:

- `Capture Metadata.md`: Contains detailed information about the capture process itself.

- `Dimension Tree.txt`: Provides a tree of all dimension folder paths of the server, not just the downloaded ones.

- `Player Entry List.csv`: Lists all players that were online during the capture including all known metadata.
